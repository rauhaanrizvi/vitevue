# Vite Vue

A Vue.js 3 setup for frontend web development and prototyping using Vite and Windi CSS.

For more on Vite, check out https://vitejs.dev/guide/ to get started. 

For more on Vue.js, check out https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html to get started. 

For more on Windi CSS, check out https://windicss.org/guide/ to get started. 

# Installing Dependencies

1. Navigate to the project root and open a terminal from there, for example:

    ```
    /var/www/project-path/
    ```

2. Install with NPM:

    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```

    For more on Composer, check out https://docs.npmjs.com/ to get started. 

# Developing for Prototyping

1. After installing the dependencies, compile with the following run script:

    ```bash
    $ npm run dev
    ```

2. Access the dev pages at http://localhost:3000/ as follows:

    * http://localhost:3000/ for the Home page

    * http://localhost:3000/about/ for the About page

    Then start developing the rest of pages inside `/src/pages/` following these two preceding examples.

# Building for Prototyping

1. After completing the development, compile with the following run script:

    ```bash
    $ npm run build
    ```

2. Access the application at the `/dist/` folder.

# Handling Static & Processed Assets

1. Use the `/src/assets/images/` folder for images that you want to be processed. Then in your HTML tags, use `@/assets/images/` to request your images, for example:
    
    ```
    <img src="@/assets/images/...-unsplash.jpg">
    ```

2. Use the `/public/static/` folder for images that you do NOT want to be processed. Then in your HTML tags, use `/static/` to request your images, for example:

    ```
    <img src="/static/...-unsplash.jpg">
    ```

# Handling Dynamic Static and Processed Assets

1. Use the `/src/assets/images/` folder for images that you want to be processed. Then in your `<script>` and `<template>` blocks, use one of the following global methods to request your images, for example:

    1. Using the `$getAsset` method (plugin):
    
        ```
        // script
        data () {
          return {
            data: {}
          }
        },

        async created () {
          let { data } = await this.$axios.get(this.$route.path)
          this.data.thumbnail = this.$getAsset(data.thumbnail)
        }

        // template
        <img :src="data.thumbnail" v-if="data.thumbnail">
        ```

        Alternatively:

        ```
        data () {
          return {
            thumbnail: null
          }
        },

        async created () {
          let { data } = await this.$axios.get(this.$route.path)
          this.thumbnail = this.$getAsset(data.thumbnail)
        }

        <img :src="thumbnail">
        ```

        Or, use the method directly in the `<template>` block without having to set the data property in the `<script>` block:

        ```
        <img :src="$getAsset(data.thumbnail)" v-if="data.thumbnail">
        ```

    2. Using the `getAsset` method (mixin):
    
        ```
        // script
        data () {
          return {
            data: {}
          }
        },

        async created () {
          let { data } = await this.$axios.get(this.$route.path)
          this.data.thumbnail = this.getAsset(data.thumbnail)
        }

        // template
        <img :src="data.thumbnail" v-if="data.thumbnail">
        ```

        Alternatively:

        ```
        data () {
          return {
            thumbnail: null
          }
        },

        async created () {
          let { data } = await this.$axios.get(this.$route.path)
          this.thumbnail = this.getAsset(data.thumbnail)
        }

        <img :src="thumbnail">
        ```

        Or, use the method directly in the `<template>` block without having to set the data property in the `<script>` block:

        ```
        <img :src="getAsset(data.thumbnail)" v-if="data.thumbnail">
        ```

    3. Using the `getAsset` method (module):
    
        ```
        // script
        import { getAsset } from '@/modules/utils'

        async created () {
          let { data } = await this.$axios.get(this.$route.path)
          this.data.thumbnail = getAsset(data.thumbnail)
        }

        // template
        <img :src="data.thumbnail" v-if="data.thumbnail">
        ```

        Alternatively:

        ```
        import { getAsset } from '@/modules/utils'

        data () {
          return {
            thumbnail: null
          }
        },

        async created () {
          let { data } = await this.$axios.get(this.$route.path)
          this.thumbnail = getAsset(data.thumbnail)
        }

        <img :src="thumbnail">
        ```

        Or, use the method directly in the `<template>` block without having to set the data property in the `<script>` block:

        ```
        import { getAsset } from '@/modules/utils'

        <img :src="getAsset(data.thumbnail)" v-if="data.thumbnail">
        ```

        It is recommended to import global methods explicitly where they are required only rather than making them globally everywhere.

2. Use the `/public/static/` folder for images that you do NOT want to be processed. Then in your `<script>` and `<template>` blocks, use one of the following global methods to request your images, for example:


    1. Using the `$getStatic` method (plugin):
    
        ```
        // script
        data () {
          return {
            data: {}
          }
        },

        async created () {
          let { data } = await this.$axios.get(this.$route.path)
          this.data = data
        }

        // template
        <img :src="$getStatic(data.static)" v-if="data.static">
        ```

        Alternatively:

        ```
        data () {
          return {
            static: null
          }
        },

        async created () {
          let { data } = await this.$axios.get(this.$route.path)
          this.static = this.$getStatic(data.static)
        }

        <img :src="static">
        ```

        Or, use the method directly in the `<template>` block without having to set the data property in the `<script>` block:

        ```
        <img :src="$getStatic(data.static)" v-if="data.static">
        ```

    2. Using the `getStatic` method (mixin):
    
        ```
        // script
        data () {
          return {
            data: {}
          }
        },

        async created () {
          let { data } = await this.$axios.get(this.$route.path)
          this.data = data
        }

        // template
        <img :src="getStatic(data.static)" v-if="data.static">
        ```

        Alternatively:

        ```
        data () {
          return {
            static: null
          }
        },

        async created () {
          let { data } = await this.$axios.get(this.$route.path)
          this.static = this.getStatic(data.static)
        }

        <img :src="static">
        ```

        Or, use the method directly in the `<template>` block without having to set the data property in the `<script>` block:

        ```
        <img :src="getStatic(data.static)" v-if="data.static">
        ```

    3. Using the `getStatic` method (module):
    
        ```
        // script
        import { getStatic} from '@/modules/utils'

        data () {
          return {
            data: {}
          }
        },

        async created () {
          let { data } = await this.$axios.get(this.$route.path)
          this.data = data
        }

        // template
        <img :src="getStatic(data.static)" v-if="data.static">
        ```

        Alternatively:

        ```
        import { getStatic} from '@/modules/utils'

        data () {
          return {
            static: null
          }
        },

        async created () {
          let { data } = await this.$axios.get(this.$route.path)
          this.static = getStatic(data.static)
        }

        <img :src="static">
        ```

        Or, use the method directly in the `<template>` block without having to set the data property in the `<script>` block:

        ```
        import { getStatic} from '@/modules/utils'

        <img :src="getStatic(data.static)" v-if="data.static">
        ```

        It is recommended to import global methods explicitly where they are required only rather than making them globally everywhere.

# Installing CSS Pre-processors

Install your favourite CSS pre-processors as follows:

1. Navigate to your root directory.

2. Install one of them (or all) via NPM:

    ```
    # .scss and .sass
    npm install -D sass

    # .less
    npm install -D less

    # .styl and .stylus
    npm install -D stylus
    ```

# Mocking Data

You need to install JSON Server and run the existing mock data as follows:

```
$ json-server --watch db.json --port 3004
```

For more on JSON Server, check out https://github.com/typicode/json-server#getting-started to get started. 

You can follow the steps below to install and create the mock data:

1. Install JSON Server:

    ```
    $ sudo npm install -g json-server
    ```

2. Navigate to the root directory and create a `db.json` with your mock data, for example:

    ```
    {
      "posts": [
        { "id": 1, "title": "json-server", "author": "Jane Doe" }
      ],
      "comments": [
        { "id": 1, "body": "some comment", "postId": 1 }
      ],
      "profile": { "name": "Jane Doe" }
    }
    ```

3. Start the JSON Server on port 3004 (or other ports as long as it is not 3000):

    ```
    $ json-server --watch db.json --port 3004
    ```

    You should see the following output on your terminal:

    ```
    \{^_^}/ hi!

    Loading db.json
    Done

    Resources
    http://localhost:3004/posts
    http://localhost:3004/comments
    http://localhost:3004/profile

    Home
    http://localhost:3004

    Type s + enter at any time to create a snapshot of the database
    Watching...
    ```

4. Now if you go to http://localhost:3004/posts/1, you should get the result below:

    ```
    { "id": 1, "title": "json-server", "author": "Jane Doe" }
    ```

# Handling SEO

Single-page apps render your site content dynamically using JavaScript and an empty HTML. Hence, search engine crawlers generally are not able to collect the content (i.e. the text) and store it in a databank.

There are two options to solve this SPA drawback in SEO:

* Generating static pages from the SPA using a static site generator.

* Converting the SPA into a server-side rendering (SSR) application.

# Generating Static Pages (Prerendering)

There are many options you can generate static pages from your SPA:

* [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/)

    However, you can't use external APIs for serving your app contents with this option. You need to use .md files to create your contents and routes locally within the VitePress app. In other words, it's a mardown-centred app that is more suitable for documentations.

* [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)

    Same with VitePress, you can't use external APIs for serving your app contents with this option. You need to use .md files to create your contents and routes locally within the VuePress app. Same with VitePress, it's a mardown-centred app that is more suitable for documentations.

* [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/)

    A Gridsome app can work with any headless CMS, API or database by using a GraphQL data layer. This means you need to know how to query your data using GraphQL queries. Hence, it can be complicated.

* [Nuxt Static Generated Mode](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/concepts/static-site-generation)

    With this option, you can use external APIs, local APIs, or even using .md files for serving your app content. But Nuxt is a SSR framework, so you need to refactor your SPA and convert it into a SSR app.

* [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)

    With this option, you don't need to refactor your SPA, you can use external APIs as it is. However, it requires extra works as you need to write some functions to use this Node library to scrape your SPA.

* [Vue Storefront Static Pages Generator](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/v1/guide/basics/static-generator.html)

    You should only go for this option if you are building an eCommerce site with Vue.js.

* https://vue-community.org/guide/ecosystem/static-site-generators.html

# Building SSR Applications

There are options you can convert your SPA into a SSR app:

* Integrating with a Node.js server-side framework manually, such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

* Using [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) directly instead. You can also integrate Nuxt with Express or using Express separately as an API without internal integration.

# Choosing Between Nuxt and Gridsome for Static Sites

The main selling point of Gridsome is GraphQL. It normalises all of your external or local data resources into single GraphQL API. If you like using GraphQL to query your data. Gridsome is definitely a good choice. You data can be local Markdown files, or any headless CMS: Contentful, WordPress, Drupal, Sanity.io, etc.

You can achieve the same in Nuxt if you want to use GraphQL. But it does not come out of the box like Gridsome. You can use [Keystone](https://keystonejs.com/) that uses [MongoDB or PostgreSQL](https://v5.keystonejs.com/quick-start/adapters) only, or you can build your own GraphQL API and server for using Markdown files as your data resources.

The GraphQL queries in Gridsome is slightly "opinionated", for example, to query a collection of posts, you need the `edges` and `node` fields:

```
query {
  allPost {
    edges {
      node {
        title
        excerpt
      }
    }
  }
}
```

While in Keystone, you can simply query your data with the following GraphQL query:

```
query {
  allPosts {
    title
    excerpt
  }
}
```

While if you use your own GraphQL API and server, you can do it in any way you want, for example:

```
query {
  postStack {
    title
    excerpt
  }
}
```

How to use the queries above in your Vue components is also slightly opinionated in Gridsome. For example, to display a post, you need to configure it manually in the `gridsome.config.js` file in the following steps:

1. Set the post URL path and component path as follows:

    ```
    // gridsome.config.js
    module.exports = {
      templates: {
        Post: [
          {
            path: '/blog/:title',
            component: './src/templates/Post.vue'
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

2. Create the post template in the `/src/templates/` directory, as follows:

    ```
    // src/templates/Post.vue
    <template>
      <Layout>
        <h1 v-html="$page.post.title"></h1>
        <div v-html="$page.post.content">
        </div>
      </Layout>
    </template>

    <page-query>
    query ($id: ID!) {
      post(id: $id) {
        title
        content
      }
    }
    </page-query>
    ```

While in Nuxt, it is more intuitive. You just have to create a new folder called `posts` in the `/pages/` directory and  a `_slug.vue` file with following code:

```
// pages/posts/_slug.vue
<template>
  <div v-if="post">
    <h2 v-html="post.title"></h2>
    <div v-html="post.content"></div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  async asyncData ({ params, error, $axios }) {
    const GET_PAGE = `
      query {
        allPosts (search: "${ params.slug }") {
          title
          content
        }
      }
    `
    let { data: { data: result } } = await $axios.post('/admin/api', {
      query: GET_PAGE
    })

    return {
      post: result.allPosts[0],
    }
  },
}
</script>
```

It is zero configuration in Nuxt. The code in the `<script>` block is longer as the preceding example code uses the plain HTTP POST method from `axios` to send out the GraphQL query. But you can make it concise with [Nuxt Apollo module](https://github.com/nuxt-community/apollo-module).

# Using Markdown Files as a Database for Nuxt

There are options if you want to use Markdown files as your database for Nuxt applications. They are as follows:

* Using the [@nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) module. You can see examples of Nuxt apps using this module to serve local Markdown files at this [repo](https://github.com/lautiamkok/Nuxt-Content). However, there is no GraphQL layer in this option. You just fetch the content like this:

    ```
    export default {
      async asyncData ({ $content }) {
        const page = await $content('home').fetch()

        return {
          page
        }
      }
    }
    ``` 

* Creating your own Markdown GraphQL API and server. This is a better option if you have time and want to build the API which you have more control. You can integrate Express or Koa with [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) to create your own GraphQL API. Or just the Apollo Server on its own. Either which, the result is rewarding. You can check out https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/ to get started.

* Using Gridsome as a GraphQL API and server. With this option, you don't have to build the API from scratch. You just have to run Gridsome and access the GraphQL API endpoint at `localhost:8081/___explore`. Then you can simply ignore the rest of Gridsome parts. This isn't ideal as it is odd to install Gridsome just for serving Markdown files from its GraphQL API.

# Notes

1. The method and data property names should not be the same. Otherwise they they will conflict with each other. For example:

    ```
    data () {
      return {
        hello: null
      }
    },

    methods: {
      hello () {...}
    },
    ```

    This pattern will yell the following error:

    ```
    [Vue warn]: Data property "hello" is already defined in Methods. 
    ```

    Same in a plain JavaScript code:

    ```
    let hello = null
    function hello () {
      //
    }
    ```

    This pattern will yell the following error:

    ```
    Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'hello' has already been declared
    ```

    Same with the following pattern:

    ```
    var hello = 'world'
    function hello () {
      return 'HELLO!'
    }

    console.log(hello) // world
    console.log(hello()) // Uncaught TypeError: hello is not a function
    ```
